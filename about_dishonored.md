<h1>Dishonored and the cost of choice</h1>

<h3>Add & Abstract</h3>
There are two important types of player choices in Dishonored:<br>

The Chaos System Tracks your GOOD or BAD actions and when a certain threshold is crossed, the game switch over into a corresponding State of LOW or HIGH Chaos. A single, specific action might push you over the edge in either direction, but it will never be enough to sway the tide on its own. It is the sum of your moment to moment gameplay decisions that changes the world and so the first important type of Player choice in Dishonored is accumulative.

The other type of player choice happens in menus where you can decide which of your powers you want to upgrade. Every single one of these choices has a huge and immediate impact on the game, radically change how you relate to the obstacles in the world, but they do not change the world itself. And so the second important type of player choice in dishonored is abstract.

It is the difference between these two types of player choices that also makes up the difference between Dishonored 1 and 2.
I am not here to determine which of the two games is more or less "flawed". I just want to compare them to better understand how they work and to , maybe, find out what they are. I am assuming you are familiar with both games and will spoil everything in the process.

<h3>The most important decision</h3>

Exchanging cutscenes, voicelines and cinematics in response to Player Choice is expensive, but making mutually exclusive gameplay-content is extremely expensive. If we want to understand what specific type of player choice each dishonored game cares about, we just have to look for the decision that has the biggest impact on gameplay.

The most important Player choice in Dishonored 1 is accumulative, because the later levels change in response to your chaos system.
Your moment to moment actions not only add up to GOOD or BAD Ending Slides, they also add up to a completely different late-game experience.
The abstract choices about powers and bonecharms will change how easy it is to be GOOD or BAD, but the most important decision, the actual player choice, is made incrementally, through the moment to moment gameplay.

Dishonored 2 also uses this Chaos System, but it does not lean into it so much. The last level will always be exactly the same, without regard for wether you have been Good or Bad . Instead, the most important choice of Dishonored 2 is abstract and it happens right in the beginning: Do you want to play Emily or Corvo? This single decision immediately locks you out of half the powers in the game and then, shortly afterwards, you get to decide if you even want any powers at all, creating a large amount of unique combinations of Character-powers-chaos rating for you to abstractedly player choose from.

In dishonored 1 you change the world accumulatively by making a single choice over and over again.<br>
In dishonored 2 you change yourself at the click of a button, while the world remains the same.

<h3>The cost of choice</h3> 

This fundamental difference between the two games also extends to their moment to moment gameplay. 

Dishonored 1, with its focus on the difference between GOOD and BAD, makes you pay a high price to be GOOD. If you want to not-kill then you have to ignore more than half of the tools that you are given. You can not shoot your pistol, you can not use crowd control, you can not drop-down-assasinate. Instead, you have to sneak, you have to slowly choke people from the shadows and you have to run away. <br><br> This is less immediate, less direct, less FUN than simply using your full arsenal, but the gratification is merely delayed. The satisfaction of stealth is just a different, slower paced, less accessible type of fun. Instead of removing every enemy in your path, you have removed yourself from their paths.<br><br> But it is the knowledge that you made an actual decision that makes this work. If you can not get past a stealth section, pulling out your grenades is a valid option. If the amount of enemies is too hight to face directly, you can hide and reduce them from the shadows. The decision between GOOD and BAD is not as frictionless as when you make it in a dialogue window, because it is the accumulative result of how you handle the challenges of moment to moment gameplay. Being BAD is easy, immediate fun, while being GOOD is a hard won satisfaction.

Dishonored 2, with its more removed, less accumulative choice making breaks this barrier between GOOD and BAD. You now have access to non-lethal melee options, more non-lethal tools and even non-lethal dropdown assasinations, meaning that you can get the immediate FUN of a videogame fight without sacrificing your status as a GOOD person.<br><br>This removal of friction makes dishonored 2 more approachable. You no longer have to restrict yourself to be GOOD and are free to experiment. Throwing and kicking enemies around is harder than just outright blasting them away, but it is explicitly fun, its explicitly immediate.<br><br>The satisfaction of Sneaking remains, but it now stands alone, without an ethically coded counterpart. The choice between STEALTH and ASSAULT has a much bigger Impact on the moment to moment gameplay than the choice between GOOD and BAD. In the case of dropdown takedowns, there is zero mechanical difference between lethal and nonlethal, there is no friction between the two options you have, because Dishonored 2 is committed to giving you as many player choices as possible, even if that means that you make them with a single button press.

<h3>The function of friction & the exctasy of emergence</h3>

In Dishonored 1 you only get to make one choice over and over again, but it will always cost you, not just in the moment to moment gameplay, but also in the long term.

In it’s high chaos version, the last levels of the game will not only be darker in tone, but also harder in gameplay. There are more weepers, more guards, more betrayals, more drama. The High chaos ending follows a traditional power curve and ends with an exciting setpiece. But the ending slides, environmental storytelling and general vibe tell you that you have reached the BAD ending. Dishonored 1 is judging you for using the tools that you were given.

Being GOOD, on the other hand, will lead to a better world and a strange, unusual payoff. The later levels become decidedly easier, as your enemies become complacent or betray each other. Instead of a big cinematic sequence you get an anticlimax. Drama and death is reserved for the BAD players. Just like with stealth, getting the good ending of Dishonored means to receive satisfaction as a reward for refusing to choose the cooler option.

You will never get everything you want in Dishonored 1 and it is exactly this friction, this uncomfortable unwillingness to completely please the player, its the fact that you have to make an actual choice, that defines the game.

But it is also this friction that makes it easy to get stuck in one specific playstyle forever.
The potentially lethal systems and abilities of Dishonored 1 can be used in extremely interesting ways, but the games harsh judgement of BAD players actively discourages experimentation. Killing is BAD and so you are tempted to reload again and again if a situation turns lethal, constantly wiping the slate clean of any, potentially interesting, knock-on effects of being spotted and causing chaos.
In the same way, some people think that stealth is boring. They just don't enjoy it and because they want to have FUN, they can never be GOOD and so they always have to kill.

It is exactly this calcification of playstyles that Dishonored 2 is attacking with its lower cost of choice.

By frontloading it's most important decisions, Dishonored 2 is explicitly inviting you to replay in a different style not only once, but multiple times with different starting parameters. You have a lot more options to choose from in the moment to moment gameplay and you get judged less for enjoying yourself. The last mission will always be the same, no matter if you have been GOOD or BAD and so you can make your decisions without loosing out on any content.

Once you embrace the chanche to accidentally kill someone, once you stop to reload and just let the systems run their course, they will produce truly unique, strange and interesting situations. This is also true for the first game, but here, in the sequel, the sheer amount of possible options, as well as the increased level size and reduced judgement for killing, leads to a incredibly rich and free sandbox experience.

Because while Dishonored 1 runs on friction,
Dishonored 2 runs on emergence.

<h3> Dedication to Drama </h3>

Where Dishonored 2 is open and free, Dishonored 1 is linear and claustrophibic.
It is full of narrow streets and cramped staircases, full of dead ends and small alleys. This compact enviornment gives the developers an almost cinematic control over when and how you see the vistas in the difference, it allows them to pace levels as a series of open and closed spaces, as a collection of dramatic differences.

Dunwall is a city of light and dark, of rich and poor, of plague and parties, it is a city of GOOD and BAD, a place as full of contrasts as one would expect from all the theatre spotlights that have been left lying around.

Some of the characters that step onto this dramatic stage are given equally dramatic weight.
Daud is THE killer, the murderer, the BAD assasin who killed the empress. You place Corvo, THE bodyguard, the protector of life, who now gets to decide if he wants to become like Daud or not. But when you finally meet the assasin, he himself has made the choice to change and asks for his life, just like you might have changed yourself, now  being unwilling to fulfill his request.

But where Dauds can be forgiven, Dishonored 1 is often incapable of delivering on its overly simplistic moral setup. To be GOOD you have to sneak and to not-kill, but most of the non-lethal takedowns are extremely cruel. These ironic reversal happen off-screen, in our imaginations, where they become much more brutal than any good clean videogame death could ever be. Lady boyles “crime” is of a sexual nature and so her punishement is as well, but as long as you dont kill the game thinks you are GOOD, even if you really aren't. In the same way, Pietro is not punished for peeking on callista, he is only ridiculed for getting caught, for being bad at stealth, because Dishonored 1 unquestioningly believes in its own ludonarrative setup.

And it is exactly this dedication to it's own ideas that defines dishonored 1. In specific instances this dedication spills over into crude tastelessness, but for the most part it just creates a dense, responsive and dramatic gameplay experience.

You have been betrayed and now you need to rescue emily and take revenge. After you get betrayed again, you rescue emily and take revenge again, but this time you climb from the lowest, plague ridden sewer to the highest hideout of the powerful in a single, breathless day.

It is this compact coherence, this dramatic arc, that, together with it's dedication to the long term reactions to your short term actions, makes dishonored 1 such an immensely replayable game.

<h3>Coded Clockwork<h3>
  
Where Dishonored 1 embraces it's GOOD/BAD dichotomy, Dishonored 2 embraces its frontloaded, abstract choice making to give you a world that is as full of different options as possible.

Karnaka is beautiful. It's facades glimmer and shine even in desolation. Blue waves crash lazily against the white walls of the lively harbor. Yes, there is poverty and bloodflies and corruption, but it doesn't spill out into the streets, it remains compartmentalised and locked away in a city that, despite its problems, looks and feels like a perfect vacation destination.
  
The streets are broad, the staircases are wide, the plazas are huge and the buildings are tall. The Levels are larger, more spacious and more interconnected, with less dead ends and more possible routes, almost infinite ways to reach your goals.
 
 

  
  
<h3> The whole wide world </h3>

These different approaches to player choice are most pronounced in the gameplay, but their effects go much deeper than that, reverberate through the games settings, plot and fantasies. The mechanical differences can be felt in every aspect of the two games.

Dishonored 1 is really committed to it's overly simplistic GOOD and BAD dichotomy.
To be GOOD you have to sneak and to not-kill, but the non-lethal takedowns are extremely cruel. These ironic reversal happen off-screen, in our imaginations, where they become much more brutal than any good clean videogame death could ever be. Lady boyles “crime” is of a sexual nature and so her punishement is as well, but as long as you dont kill the game thinks you are GOOD, even if you really aren't. In the same way, Pietro is not punished for peeking on callista, he is only ridiculed for getting caught, for being bad at stealth, because Dishonored 1 unquestioningly believes in its own ludonarrative setup. Daud is the BAD, murdering Assasin, while you are the GOOD bodyguard who protects life, but when you meet again, your roles might have changed.

Dunwall is as full of contrasts as you would expect from all the spotlights that have been left lying around, its a city of rich and poor, of bright and dark, of healthy and sick, of GOOD and BAD, a city that runs on a dramatic arc, where you get betrayed, have to rescue emily and take revenge. The first two levels follow the same structure and introduce the city before the sokolv bridge and lady boaylse social stealth mix up the gameplay. Inbetween missions the many NPCs of the hounds pit pub react to your choices and give you your sidequest. After you get betrayed again, you rescue emily and take revenge again, but this time you climb from the lowest, plague ridden sewer to the highest hideout of the powerful in a single, breathless day.


Because Karnaka is beautiful. It's facades glimmer and shine even in desolation and corruption. Blue waves crash lazily against the white walls of the lively harbor. The bloodflies dont spill out of their infected houses. Wide staircases run through tall buildings, connecting appartements and balconies to huge plazas and broad streets as you make your way through a city that feels like a perfect vacation destination.

In a general move away from the ethical problems of the first game, nonlethal takedowns are no longer ironic reversals but restorative, resetting your targets to how they were before theymet delilah. Only Jindosh, the arrogant tech bro stand-in gets it bad, perhaps as a kind of apology for what happened to Lady Boyle.

Instead of Daud, Dishonored 2 uses Dr. Hypatia to reflect the potential for GOOD and BAD that the player carries within them, but instead of having that confrontation at the end of the game,

* All missions are small steps towards your single, overarching goal of bringing down delilah. The levels you travel through are disconnected from one another and instead all have memorable, unique selling points. As usual, the jindosh mansion and the crack in the slab stand out.

* The Stilton manor allows you to experience the long term effects of your short term actions in fast forward. If you kill stilton, the world becomes BAD, if you dont kill him, the world become GOOD, but the change happens instantly and does not spill over into the gameplay of the other levels.

* Jindosh Mansion is a level designers dream. Just like the testing chambers of Portal, it makes the artificial nature of videogames diegetic. The debugging voicelines of the clockwork soldiers run on the same code as the barks of human NPCs, but they have more movement options than humans, they are more versatile. They allow you to have FUN while fighting them because they are not alive and therefor, destroying them is not BAD.

Dishonored 2 is like the jindosh lock. It only leads to one place, but how you open it is always different. 
Dishonored 1 is like the water lock.  There is only one way through it, but the place it leads to varies.

<h3>ImSim</h3>

Dishonored 1 is a bridge game between the older, jankier Immersive Sims and the modern games of the genre. Old Games like Thief, Deus ex and System Shock all try to make you believe in the first person perspective, are all trying to immerse you, not only through 3D polygon counts, but also through how you interact with the world. These games are deliberate attempts to get away from gun-only-gameplay and in doing so they enter janky, uncharted territory where actions take ages, where inventories are based on drag and drop and where you have a specific key-item you need to select if you want to open a door.

These old immersive sims are full of friction, full of strange quirks and slow interaction patterns that you need to learn if you want to play at all and this is a large part of what makes them immersive, even today.

The faster, the smoother, the more convenient it is to just move my character, the less i need to understand its specific physicality, the less I need to learn about them. But it is through learning, through trial and error that these old games slowly reveal themselves to you. Once you have learned how to use their somewhat experimental systems, you will feel a sense of ownership over them. 

On its own, this is just how videogames work, what sets the old immersive sims apart is that they dont just model murder, that they try to treat their worlds as more-dimensional, that they have more than just combat simulations, that they allow you to play your own way.

On the surface, dishonored 1 is a modern game. Its controls are standardised, its quick access wheel is best practictified and the all powerful contextual "E" button always knows which keys you have. The friction, the jankyness of old Immersive Sims is less surface level, less easy to find, but it is still there. Where it's predecessors require you to immerse yourself into their control schemes, Dishonored 1 requires you to immerse yourself in it's morality system. 
If you are BAD, you will get the exciting ending, if you are GOOD you will get an anti-climax. From the perspective of its own internal logic, this makes sense, from a modern videogame perspective, this is strange and weird, and it is exactly this friction, this unwillingness to try to always please every player, that defines dishonored 1.

Dishonored 2 removes that friction and replaces it with so many player choices. Making the hard decision between GOOD and BAD is now merely one of many tasty options that the buffet of Dishonored 2 offers you. This truly modern game is not interested in making you believe in its world, it wants you to enjoy its gameplay, it wants you to replay the scenario for days, with the variables replaced, and to facilitate that, it needs to be as smooth as possible.

Arkanes other Immersive Sims are also all moving into this less judgemental and more emergent direction. They are becoming less linear and more explicit about their status as simulations, turning into a collection of interactive systems that can all talk to each other but that dont have a lot to say, allowing you to enjoy them for what they are, instead of confronting you with what they want to represent.

I did not write  this text to determine which Dishonored is "genius" and which is "garbage". I just wanted to compare the two games, to better understand how they work and to find out what they are.
Now i can finally say that:

* Dishonored 1 is immersive, while
* Dishonored 2 is a simulation.

Thank you for reading.
