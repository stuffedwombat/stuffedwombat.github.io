<h1> about Dishonored 1 & 2</h1>

This is the script for a youtube video that I am currently (14.04.22) too busy to record & edit.<br>
To get it out of my head, I have put it here.

<h3> intro</h3>
Killing is BAD.<br>
Not-killing is GOOD.<br>
Dishonored is about player choice.

I am not here to decide which of the two Dishonored games is more or less "flawed", I just want to compare them to each other to better understand how they work and to find out, what they are.
I am assuming that you are familiar with both games and will be spoiling everything in the process.

<h3>player choices</h3>

There are two important types of player choices in Dishonored:

* The Chaos System Tracks your GOOD or BAD actions and when a certain threshold is crossed, the game switch over into a corresponding State of LOW or HIGH Chaos. A single, specific action might push you over the edge in either direction, but it will never be enough to sway the tide on its own. It is the sum of your moment to moment gameplay decisions that changes the world and so the first important type of Player choice in Dishonored is accumulative.

* The other type of player choice happens in menus where you can decide which of your powers you want to upgrade. Every single one of these choices has a huge and immediate impact on the game. They radically change how you relate to the obstacles in the world, but they do not change the world itself. And so the second important type of player choice in dishonored is abstract.

Exchanging cutscenes, voicelines and cinematics in response to Player Choice is expensive, but making mutually exclusive gameplay-content is extremely expensive. And so, if we want to understand what specific player choice each dishonored game cares about the most, we just have to search for the choice that leads to the most mutual exclusivity.

<h3>the cost of choice</h3>

And, as it turns out, the difference between accumulative and abstract player choice is also the main difference between Dishonored 1 and Dishonored 2.

* The most important Player choice in Dishonored 1 is accumulative, because the later levels of the game change in response to your chaos system. Your moment to moment actions not only add up to GOOD or BAD Ending Slides, they also add up to a completely different late-game experience Your abstract choices about powers and bonecharms will change how easy it is to be GOOD or BAD, but the most important decision, the actual player choice, is made incrementally, through the moment to moment gameplay.

* Dishonored 2 also uses this Chaos System, but it does not lean into it so much. The last level will always be exactly the same, without regard for wether you have been Good or Bad . Instead, the most important choice of Dishonored 2 is abstract. it happens right in the beginning: Do you want to play Emily or Corvo? This single decision immediately locks you out of half the powers in the game and then, shortly afterwards, you get to decide if you even want any powers at all, creating a large amount of unique combinations of Character-powers-chaos rating for you to abstractedly player choose from.

In dishonored 1 you change the world accumulatively by making a single choice over and over again.
In dishonored 2 you change yourself at the click of a button, while the world remains the same.

<h3>friction emerges</h3>

In Dishonored 1 you only get to make one choice over and over agait, but it will always cost you, not just in the moment to moment gameplay, but also in the long term.

In it’s high chaos version, the last levels of the game will not only be darker in tone, but also harder in gameplay. There are more weepers, more guards, more betrayals, more drama. The High chaos ending follows a traditional power curve and ends with an exciting setpiece. But the ending slides, environmental storytelling and general vibe tell you that you have reached the BAD ending. Dishonored 1 is judging you for using the tools that you were given.

Being GOOD, on the other hand, will lead to a better world and a strange, unusual payoff. The later levels become decidedly easier, as your enemies become complacent or betray each other. Instead of a big cinematic sequence you get an anticlimax. Drama and death is reserved for the BAD players. Just like with stealth, getting the good ending of Dishonored means to receive satisfaction as a reward for refusing to choose the cooler option.

You will never get everything you want in Dishonored 1 and it is exactly this friction, this uncomfortable unwillingness to completely please the player, its the fact that you have to make an actual choice, that defines the game.

<h3>emergence exhilerates</h3>

But it is also this friction that makes it easy to get stuck in one specific playstyle forever.
The potentially lethal systems and abilities of Dishonored 1 can be used in extremely interesting ways, but the games harsh judgement of BAD players actively discourages experimentation.

Especially The Ghost & clean hands achievements push you to always reload when you make a mistake, resetting the game back into its static state of non-discovery.
Being GOOD might be satisfying, but it also removes a large part of the emergent FUN from the game.

And it is exactly this calcification of playstyles that Dishonored 2 is attacking with its lower cost of choice.

By frontloading its most important decisions, Dishonored 2 is explicitly inviting you to replay it in a different style not only once, but multiple times with different starting parameters. You have a lot more options to choose from in the moment to moment gameplay and you get judged less for enjoying yourself. The last mission will always be the same, no matter if you have been GOOD or BAD.

Dishonored 2 gives a large quantity of choices, leading to a large very amount of game states so that as many unique situations as possible can emerge from them, which is just plain old FUN. 
Not-reloading, just playing around, letting the systems run their course to produce truly unique, strange, interesting situations is extremely enjoyable in a way that the videogame-violence of the first game wasnt, simply because you always have access such a wide range of options.

<h3>deadly drama</h3>

If Dishonored 2 runs on emergence, then Dishonored 1 runs on friction. This difference extends out from the gameplay and spills over onto every other aspect of the two games.

Because Dishonored 1 is really committed to its overly simplistic GOOD/BAD dichotomy.
To be good you have to sneak and to not kill, but the non-lethal takedowns are extremely cruelly ironic. Lady boyles “crime” is of a sexual nature and so her punishement is as well. As long as you dont kill, the game thinks you are GOOD, even if you really arent. In the same way, Pietro is not punished for peeking on callista, he is only ridiculed for getting caught, for being bad at stealth, because Dishonored 1 unquestioningly believes in its own ludonarrative setup.

This extends to the city. Dunwall is as full of contrast as you would expect from all the spotlights that have been left lying around, its a city of rich and poor, of bright and dark, of healthy and sick, of GOOD and BAD. 

Following the stageplay setup, characters are used representationally and are allowed to evolve. Daud starts as a BAD Assasin,as the murderer, but then becomes regretful. You start as a GOOD bodyguard who protects life, but when you meet daud, you yourself might have changed  already.

The Drama of Good & Bad is built on a dramatic gameplay arc. Your goals are to rescue emily and take to revenge. The first two missions are about emily and both start in the same location, grounding you in dunwall. To not repeat itself too much, Dishonored mixes things up with the vertical bridge level and the social stealth of lady boyle as you get closer to the lord regents relatively easy and conventional level. 
After you are betrayed you just rescue emily and take revenge again, but this time you do it in a single day, climbing from the lowest gutter and the diseased streets to the highest, most reclusive tower of dunwall.

<h3>coded clockwork</h3>

If DIshonored 1 runs on a dramatic arc, then Dishonored 2 is compartmentalised. 

You move between Dunwall and Karnaka quickly while long stretches of in-game time pass. Your hub is literally un-grounded and gameplay elements are no longer represented in characters.

In a general move away from its ethical problems, Nonlethal Takedowns are now restorative, only the tech-bro stand-in jindosh is punished ironically, as a kind of redemption for what happened to  Lady Boyle.

All missions are small steps towards your single, overarching goal of bringing down delilah. The levels you travel through are disconnected from one another and instead all have memorable, unique selling points. As usual, the jindosh mansion and the crack in the slab stand out.

The Stilton manor allows you to experience the long term effects of your short term actions in fast forward. If you kill stilton, the world becomes BAD, if you dont kill him, the world become GOOD, but the change happens instantly and does not spill over into the gameplay of the other levels.

Jindosh Mansion is a level designers dream. Just like the testing chambers of Portal, it makes the artificial nature of videogames diegetic. The debugging voicelines of the clockwork soldiers run on the same code as the barks of human NPCs, but they have more movement options than humans, they are more versatile. They allow you to have FUN while fighting them because they are not alive and therefor, destroying them is not BAD.

Dishonored 2 is like the jindosh lock. It has many unique combinations and ways to solve it, but solving it always leads to the same place.

<h3>ImSim</h3>
D1 is a bridge game between the older, jankier Immersive Sims and the modern games of the genre. Old Games like Thief, Deus ex and System Shock all try to make you believe in the first person perspective, are all trying to immerse you, not only through 3D polygon counts, but through how you interact with that world. These games are deliberate attempts to get away from gun-only-gameplay and in doing so they enter uncharted territory where actions take ages, where inventories are based on drag and drop and where you have a specific key-item you need to select if you want to open a door.

These old immersive sims are full of friction, full of strange quirks and slow interaction patterns that you need to learn if you want to play at all and this is a large part of what makes them immersive, even today.

The faster, the smoother, the more convenient it is to just move my character, the less i need to understand its specific physicality, the less I need to learn about them. But it is through learning, through trial and error that these old games slowly reveal themselves to you. Once you have learned how to use their somewhat experimental systems, you will feel a sense of ownership over them, you will have grown fond of them.

On its own, this is just how videogames work, what sets the old immersive sims apart is that they dont just model murder, that they try to treat their worlds as more-dimensional, that they have more than just combat simulations, that they allow you to play your own way.

On the surface, dishonored 1 is a modern game. Its controls are standardised, its quick access wheel is best practiced and the all powerful contextual E button always knows which keys you have. The friction, the jankyness of old Immersive Sims is less surface level, less easy to find, but it is still there. Where old games require you to immerse yourself into their control schemes, dishonored 1 requires you to immerse yourself in its morality system. 
If you are BAD, you will get the dramatic ending, if you are GOOD you will get an anti-climax. From the perspective of its own internal logic, this makes sense, from a modern videogame perspective, this is strange and weird, this is a point of friction and it is exactly that friction, that unwillingness to try to always please every player, that defines dishonored 1.

Contract d1 part

Dishonored 2 removes that friction and replaces it with so many player choices. Making the hard decision between GOOD and BAD is now merely one of many tasty options that the buffet of Dishonored 2 offers you. Dishonroed 2 is not interested in making you believe in its world, it wants you to enjoy its gameplay, it wants you to replay the scenario for days, with the variables replaced, and to facilitate that, it needs to be as smooth as possible.

Arkanes other Immersive Sims are also all moving into this less judgemental and more emergent direction. They are becoming less linear and more explicit about their status as simulations, turning into a collection of interactive systems that can all talk to each other but that dont have a lot to say, allowing you to enjoy them for what they are, instead of confronting you with what they want to represent.

Where Dishonored 1 has audiologs that tell you stories about the world, 
Dishonored 2 has typewriters that allow you to tell your own stories about yourself.


While my personal preference has definitely been been shining through, I did not make this video to determine which dishonored is genius and which is garbage, I wanted to compare the two games, to better understand how they work and to find out what they are and now i can finally say that

Dishonored 1 is immersive while
Dishonored 2 is a simulation.

Thank you for ~~watching~~ reading.
