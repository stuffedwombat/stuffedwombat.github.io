<h2>Introduction</h2>

This is a non linear book about making games.

- If you just want to see what this book has to offer, check out the [index](lr_index), which is a list of all the chapters of this book. You can then just pick whatever catches your interest and go from there.

- If you want to read about the smallest part that games are made out of, then I would recommend to check out the chapter on [Decisions](lr_decisions).

- If you are hungry for some fairly abstract, weird and somewhat insane perspectives on game development, then I would recommend reading about [Doors](lr_doors) instead.

- If you are feeling rebellious you should just open the book at a random page and read from there. While I would recommend to actually start with the beginning of the chapter you land on, I can not stop you from being truly chaotic.

- Alternatively you can, of course, just close this book and do something else instead. That is always possible.
