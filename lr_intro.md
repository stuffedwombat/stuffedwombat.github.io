This is a prototype for an interactive non-fiction book. 

<h1>About making games.</h1>

This book is non linear.
Just pick a chapter that interests you and start reading it.
At the end of each chapter, there will be links to other chapters that relate to the one you just read.
You can follow these recommendations or set out on your own.
Hope you enjoy!

- I would recommend to start by checking out the [index](lr_index). It contains a list of all chapters in this book. You can just pick one that interests you and read from there.
- But you could also start by reading about the smallest parts, the atoms, of any game: [Decisions](lr_decisions).
- If you want to start with some fairly abstract and weird stuff, I would recommend reading about [Doors](lr_doors) instead.
