This is a prototype for a interactive non-fiction book. 

<h1>About making games.</h1>

This book is non linear.
Just pick a chapter that interests you and start reading it.
At the end of each chapter, there will be links to other chapters that relate to the one you just read.

You can, of course, also come back to this index at any time and look for chapters you have not read yet.
