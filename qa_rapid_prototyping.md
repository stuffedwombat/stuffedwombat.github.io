### How does having walks in the forest help you in gamedev? And travelling?

I need long walks where, even if I don't pay attention to my surroundings, I won't get run over by a car. This allows me to just let the mind wander which often lead to strange insights and surprising connections. It also alleviates backpain and brings me out into the fresh air.

Travelling completely rips me out of my comfort zone & routine, shaking everything up and allowing me to return back home with a new set of eyes.

Essentially, both walks and travels pull me out of my surroundings and give me new perspectives on things, which is crucial when you have to make creative decisions. Often I would go on a walk and then, 20 minutes later, out of nowhere, I would realise that I had to cut a specific feature or the game wouldn't get finished in time. It's about giving your brain time to process and catalogue and do it's own thing in the background while you just kind of wander around and look at nice stuff.

The important thing is to not go for a walk (or book a vacation) with the desire to achieve some specific thing. Any type of pressure or expectation stops the brain from doing it's own thing. Just gotta go out and smell the flowers/concrete.

### Which of your projects is the most fun to revisit?

They are all like windows into the past for me. I play them and remember how I felt when I made them, so everything is interesting. I don't really go back to play them for fun and to be honest, I actually can't remember the last time I booted up an old game of mine again.

@DicedBasilisk asks:
### Any tips and tricks of rapid prototyping, or however you like to go about testing game ideas out so quickly?

Three things come to mind immediatly:

#### Get comfortable with failing
If your prototype isn't doing what you hoped it would, throw it away. Don't be too precious about specific ideas or approaches. Holding on to a failed prototype and investing more and more time into it in order to salvage the previous effort is just going to leave you with a thing that you won't recognise. Instead of trying to realise a specific vision, it will only be a reaction to the problems you encountered. Such a thing can not serve as a building block for future work, it just muddies the water with weak direction.

#### Work within your technical comfort zone
You don't want to constantly have to look up how to code that specific thing again. If you can't realise your idea quickly and without substantial googling, then the idea is too complicated for you right now. Simplify it, dumb it down, abstract it and try again. 

#### Work on a large conceptual scale
The prototype you are making right now is just a small stepping stone towards a larger goal. You are not trying to find the perfect implementation of that cool idea you had, you are just exploring the possibility space around that idea. If you try to approach the same concept from 3 angles I guarantee you that you will find surprising commonalities and contrasts, the kind of raw fundamentals that you can use to make something that's genuinly your own.
