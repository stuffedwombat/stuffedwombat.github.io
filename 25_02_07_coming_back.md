Today I did a proper day-in-the-city type thing, buying a year of admission to the museum of art history, which I genuinly do intend to visit again a couple of times. It felt very nice to be around people all day, eating and walking.

I’d grown more inward directed during the last month, becoming unaware to the things happening outside of myself. This might have also been a kind of defense mechanisim against the outside world, but it definitely lead to some really bad things.

I’ve been reading bits of Eat, Pray, Love before falling asleep and it has been very comforting.

While I am still very happy with TIMER REMOVER, I kind of wish I had not put the link to the text so directly into the descriptions. Of all the relations that people seemed to have had with the game, the one where they quickly gave up trying to read the text while playing and just went to read the text was the one I had least hoped to happen. I assume that I’ll keep iterating on this concept and it’s wider presentation.

The rough check-in on my money situation has unearthed no great cause for alarm, but it’s a very good thing that I’ve finally managed to get release something again. It’s time to get to work!

That work has already been going on this week. It’s in a very relaxing mode, where I don’t need to make too many decisions. I’ve also been chatting a lot more with colleagues recently, kind of spitballing loosely. I have been also thinking a lot about hyper-specific games. Kind of extreme abstractions, more like a canvas than an actual picture. Engines. It would be nice to make a little engine. 

And then: Finally. Finally. Finally. I have managed to play a couple of games again. It was nice. Games are nice. Wew. It’s really been a long while since I’d played so many games in such a short time. Games.
