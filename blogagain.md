**no blog again*

I've been very happy. I've been thinking to myself that these days are the good days and that I should enjoy them. And I do. It's exhausting in a way that doesn't seem to deplete my long term energy. Things do really go wrong, but overall, they don't. Not really. It's good stuff.

The background work I'd been talking about has come into the foreground of my game dev activities, but making games has taken moved into the background of my general activities.

I got really into interior design and kitchen design and glassware design and waterheater design and space design and a whole bunch of other physical designs. 

The last week has shown me again how cool it can be to make videogames, but for a while I was really running away from the computer. That's still where I want to go in the long term, but for now I will keep at making games. There's some really cool ideas to try out. 

In addition to all of these things that are happening in my life, there are also things that are happening in my life that are private. These are actually the most intense ones. I will not share them with you. Sorry :)

And so this blog ends. 

No more blog again. 

Maybe, probably, I'll do one of these runs again, but this one has run it's course. I'll probably switch to irregular and more article-style writing. 

There's a lot of stuff that I wanted to talk about in these blogs that I never got to. Maybe I'll finally tackle that intro into indie industry. If I end up writing something. Who knows.

See you soon!
Take care :)
