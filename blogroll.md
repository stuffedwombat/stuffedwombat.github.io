**06.01.23 - the week of 3D**

I'd made two new years resolutions:
- use as little screens as possible on the weeekends
- write a diary entry before going to sleep everyday

The idea was to not attempt something specific, but to create as many opportunities for reflection as possible. Then, if I want to do something specific, I can spend all the videogame-less weekends and late night writing sessions to think about it. That worked pretty well for Producer and so far it also seems to work for real life.

Not that I actually got anything done. I now just have a detailed record of a week full of semi-failure.

Two projects I'd planned on starting this week got pushed back, leaving me antsy and weird. Unable to focus and confused, I caught up on all the screen time I'd missed on the weekend, playing through SIGNALIS twice.

Luckily, the deadline for a submission was also pushed back, so while my lackluster effort on it wasn't rewarded, it also wasn't punished. Yay?

Thanks to the steam sale, PRODUCER has sold more than 1000 units! Yay!

The main event of the week, however, was intense and sudden backpain. Not inexplicable, but unexpected. Why now? I'd been going... oh, yeah. I'd stopped going on walks.

Back to that, then. 

And wow. Why did I ever stop? I guess it was a slow process, a gradual erosion, like always when habits die. But how could this happen? I love going on walks. It's weirdly warm right now and sometimes I don't even need a jacket. 

I climb up through a path of tight trees and emerge into a wide panorama, tall blue clouds parralaxing like distant mountains above rolling hills of orange reeds.

The sunsets are glorious red and blue and purple and sometimes yellow, bright and surreal in the afternoon.

There is thick fog at night and I can't even see 3 meters ahead of me. The trees are black silhouettes and hikers rotate their phones like lighthouses. A car cuts through the white soup only to dissolve in it a short time later.

I hike and wander and think of 3D level desigm. How rich and dense. How many possibilities for amazing vistas and winding passages. If only I could work with that.

I can't, so I close off this wildly unproductive week with a little private game jam. [The result](https://stuffedwombat.itch.io/slippy) is quite nice. Maybe I'll get some shit done next week. I really have to. There's not much time left.

Cheers,

**30.12.22 - the year of productivity**

Last friday of the year. Time to look back.

In 20222 I learned how to work. Like, really work. Not the fitful start and stop, nor the desperate sprinting of previous projects but real, hard, continous work.

The naked power of routine. Get up, work, walk, cook, sleep. Meet friends on the weekends. Don't get too drunk. Don't stay up too late. Focus. Externally boring,  internally explosive.

Going over PRODUCER again and again, always cutting, always boiling it down into the thickest possible stew of itself.

The goal now is to get back there. Back into the longterm flow, which, of course, requires a certain amount of headless chicken time to accumulate fresh ideas and theories.

But I'm getting ahead of myself.

The year actually started with a certain disrespect toward work and it's processes. I'd already thaught a class that was very well received, so surely I'd be able to do it again without preparing too much!

Wrong. The first 6 months of 2022 were a slow trainwreck. Unable to get my course back on track completely and equally unable to work on PRODUCER, I instead fled forward into a new project.

GEBALLER is a pretty nice game, considering how much I fucked up the development cycle. We developed amazing tools early on and then, scared and unable to make decisions, I never really used them. At least the few people that bought the game seemed to enjoy it.

We had some updates planned, but the programmer has dissapeared from the face of the earth. Felix, for fucks sake, call me.

With both the course and GEBALLER wrapped up I was able to escape from all of my problems for 2 weeks to spain. It was that break, that first vacation in many years, that kept me from folding in on myself after all of these failures. Mucho Gracias.

Then, bed-bound with corona for a week, deliriously dreaming I was a 3D tetris piece. Then, a whole summer of extensive physical activity in a desperate attempt to to balance out the long term dmg. Swimming is the best.

This is when the work really started. I realised how much there was to do and started cutting. One month later I started to summarise my work in blogposts. I needed to become more effective to finish the game. The weekly reflections helped me to come up with procecesses and identify bottle-necks like never before. I worked consistently, but rarely more than 5 hours per day. It grew more stressful with autuum. The swimming stopped. The game got done.

Then, of course, the inevitable breakdown after release. The hat hurts, no matter how old.

A kind of loose phase of playing a whole bunch of games. Preparing the next steps by exploring in 400 directions at once. Finding a few really interesting things. Getting within reach of recouping the cost of making PRODUCER with to heavy discounts. Deciding to return to the road and being surprised with a whole boat-load of opportunities. Hoping to be able to get back to work soon. To that beautiful place of purpose and progress.

Cheers,
josh


**23.12.22 - the week of starting to leave**

This last week has been marked by a committed avoidance of working on Producer yet again. At least I didn't work on anything else either, so it balances out.

I did do a lot of thinking and deciding though!

The explosive prototyping energy has ebbed, leaving me with four pretty well defined ideas. Each of them would be worth pursuing in their own right, but only two have commercial potential. Both of those contain writing, but approach it from two completely different perspectives. 

One uses variables from game-y gameplay to determine branching, while the other requires you to take real-life notes to solve a detective case. Deciding between them would've been impossible if not for some outside influence:

I got a small & very part-time freelance job! Again! This time I won't fuck it up though! I hope? Yay! It's about developing complicated level design patterns. Funnily enough, that's also what I'll be doing for an as-of-yet secret collaboration with another game developer that I've been wanting to work with for years!

My pensum for traditional game-y game design being thusly filled quite to the brim, I can safely discard the former prototype in favour of the latter.
Decisionmaking! Hurray!

The other big decision that was made was to move out of my current, extremely low-rent, habitat. I've spent the pandemic (which is not over but you know what I mean) in a former air-bnb, out in the semi-country side. While it's been quite nice and beautiful and full of trees, I feel like I need to return to urban society. Or at least move closer to other people my age.

Falling perfectly in line with this desire, a couple of opportunities for low/free rent have presented themselves to me on the international stage. If everything goes well I'll spend the next 6 months on the road, scurrying from couch to couch like a belaptopped roach.

And so this week has been spent on getting ready to leave. Tying up loose ends, sorting through unkept books and generally preparing to bananabox the majority of my belongings.

As part of these preparations, I've also gotten a fully functioning smartphone for the first time in forever. There's now a very strict "no screens in bed" policy to protect me from this pocket demon.

It's been a stressful & expensive week, but it's extremely nice to be moving again.

I've spent the last years mainly in this one room, alone in front of the computer, working on qomp, Geballer, Producer and all the essays.
I learned to cook and went on a lot of hikes and met up with friends on the weekends for some more hikes and boardgames. It's been extremely nice. A kind of very comfortable halfway house between the nerveous breakdown of three years ago and the hopefully normal-human-shaped future.

Let's see what happens.

cheers,<br>

**17.12.22 - the week of various meadows**

Work work, time for some more work! But it's all pretty relaxed, really. It's more of a tentative exploring of various avenues. There's that flowery kind of spring in the step as one frolicks across beautiful meadows.

This is not the time of hunched shoulders. No bunkering down, no incresingly creased furrows. The deadlines aren't even written into the sand yet. All is easy. Mostly.

I'm having trouble writing words, so I'll just create some systems and setups to display words instead. It's technically productive. The gifs get likes on twitter.

There are a couple of situations floating around in my head, but I can't commit to just putting one of them down onto the interactive paper. It's going to be horrible garbage in the beginning and I don't have the strenght to sift through that right now, so off we go, to some other project. Only for now, I hope.

There's producer, sitting there and waiting for an update and an itch.io page and a steamdeck compatability check and a soundtrack and probably some other stuff. It's been patient so far, why not let it simmer just a bit longer?

Because, look, there's this cool little game I made some months ago, but it's being held back by it's obscure control scheme! So, I'm going to rework the controls and add a  difficulty curve and also make all of these fun tools and oh my, two days have passed!

Well, better get back on track by recreating Disco Elysium's dialogue system in my own weird framework! Once I got the tech down, I'll be able to create, like, a couple of cool short stories using passive skillchecks and stats and all of that cool stuff. Like, once the tech is done, it's going to be amazing and I will finally start to actually write. I'm sure of it. For real. Trust me.

But then again, do I really need to start writing? Isn't it a bit soon? Shouldn't I relax a bit more? Shouldn't I read some nice and easy books? Shouldn't I be buying christmas presents for my family?

Oh shit gtg
