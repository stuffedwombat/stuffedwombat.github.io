**17.12.22 - week of meadows**

Work work, time for some more work! But it's all pretty relaxed, really. It's more of a tentative exploring of various avenues. There's that flowery kind of spring in the step as one frolicks across beautiful meadows.

This is not the time of hunched shoulders. No bunkering down, no incresingly creased furrows. The deadlines aren't even written into the sand yet. All is easy. Mostly.

I'm having trouble writing words, so I'll just create some systems and setups to display words instead. It's technically productive. The gifs get likes on twitter.

There are a couple of situations floating around in my head, but I can't commit to just putting one of them down onto the interactive paper. It's going to be horrible garbage in the beginning and I don't have the strenght to sift through that right now, so off we go, to some other project. Only for now, I hope.

There's producer, sitting there and waiting for an update and an itch.io page and a steamdeck compatability check and a soundtrack and probably some other stuff. It's been patient so far, why not let it simmer just a bit longer?

Because, look, there's this cool little game I made some months ago, but it's being held back by it's obscure control scheme! So, I'm going to rework the controls and add a  difficulty curve and also make all of these fun tools and oh my, two days have passed!

Well, better get back on track by recreating Disco Elysium's dialogue system in my own weird framework! Once I got the tech down, I'll be able to create, like, a couple of cool short stories using passive skillchecks and stats and all of that cool stuff. Like, once the tech is done, it's going to be amazing and I will finally start to actually write. I'm sure of it. For real. Trust me.

But then again, do I really need to start writing? Isn't it a bit soon? Shouldn't I relax a bit more? Shouldn't I read some nice and easy books? Shouldn't I be buying christmas presents for my family?

Oh shit gtg
