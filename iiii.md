<h1>intro into indie industry</h1>

Rich people bet on a sure thing, lost and made it everyone elses problem.

Now, with large chunks ripped out of the games industry, Publishers are starting to focus their attention on smaller developers.


As a tiny indie, your strongest asset is the personal voice you’ve cultivated over the years of learning your craft. Your style. This, much more than any market considerations, is what pushes people to recommend your game to their friends.

It’s been this kind genuine excitement that made low-to-no-budget games like Townscaper,  SNKRX, Pseudoregalia and Yomi Hustle so profitabie. These games were made by people with very specific interests and in defiance of current market logic. Thanks to their uniqueness (and low price point), they spread not by traditional marketing channels, but by word of mouth. 

This organic, genuine excitement is what publishers are hoping to buy into as they start to invest into tiny developers. Publishers can not pay someone to be truly excited about a game, but they can try to get a piece from a game that seem like it will inspire those kinds of feelings.

I haven’t been a fan of publishers for a while, but now that they’re actively moving into the market of tiny indies (that I feel myself belonging to), I feel compelled to speak up:

- If a publishers wants you, you do not need them.

Publishers are buying you as a cheap lottery ticket, hoping that whatever you’ve been obsessed with connects with a large audience. They want what you have, not the other way around. To give up 30-50% of your games revenue in exchange for promises of “marketing” is ridiculous in the current, community-driven indie scene. 

- If you need a publisher, they don’t want you

Your game will either sell itself, or it won’t sell. 

If you are a tiny developer working on a game in an established genre, without putting your own, genuine, twist on it, you are no longer competing for the genuine appreciation of a few freaks, you are competing against opportunists who are much better at selling out than you. And you will loose.


So what should you do?

- Don’t waste time on trying to appeal to a publisher.

Focus on your own interests. Follow your little weirdo nature without thinking about money for as long as you possibly can. The things you discover if you let go of the desire to become rich are, ironically, the things that have the highest chance of working out financially.

The more you try to force your creativity into a specific direction (that you presume to be profitable) the less the creativity will flow. Even if you end up making a game that sells, money (and making even more of it) will be all that’s on your mind from here on out. I’ve never seen someone who sold out in cold blood actually enjoy their work afterwards.

Being an indie developer is about enjoying the work. If you don’t enjoy what you do, the uncertainty, the stress, even the profit is not worth it. The goal is always just to make enough money to take a break, reflect and then make the next game at your own pace. 

If you’re struggling financially while trying to finish your indie game right now, all of this will make you sad and furious with me. How can you focus on what you enjoy when you’re worrying about money everyday? The advice I give is only useful for people who don’t have to worry about money.

You’re right.

The shitty truth is that the careers of most indies have not been funded by publishers, but by parents, partners and welfare states. Did you ever wonder why so many indies come from northern europe, with it’s social security and health insurance?

Most of your favourite indie games are built on this kind of privilege, on the ability to trade social status for following a dream for years without making substantial money. In case of financial failure, most of us could just move back in with our families (if we’re not already living with them right now). 

I can’t seriously ask anyone to reject a publishing deal that would lift them out of immediate poverty, just because of artistic principles. I am not doing that. My point is that, without having spent significant time on following your own interest and building up your personally style, you’re very unlikely to ever even get a deal. Pursing one at the expense of becoming a more confident developer is a waste of time.


I’ve seen many people twist themselves into knots over the years, trying to appeal to various publishers, funds and investors. I’ve watched them abandon all the things they initially enjoyed about game development, chasing some large cheque that would make it all worth it. I’ve never seen it work out. 

Even if you’re successful, you can easily shoehorn yourself into a position where you’re forced to provide a specific experience to a specific audience, where you’ve lost your creative autonomy, where you’re no longer truly independant.

Publishers love sequels. They love clear target audiences. The love safe bets. 

Eventually (but inevitably) they’ll oversaturate their market segment with too many safe bets. The paradigms that they relied on will no longer work. Studios will collapse. People will get laid off and then, suddenly, the outsiders, the weirdos and the freaks, the unsigneables with their strange ideas and their low budgets become attractive once more.


- Maintain your autonomy. Stay Indie. Stay weird.

They’ll come to you, as soon as you no longer need them.

**a quick note on bias:**

I genuinely believe what I say here, but please be aware that, whenever anyone speaks about matters of economy, their analysis is much more indicative of their own situation than of the general one.

- When Mike Rose says that “Indie publishing is fucked”, he does so because his buisness model (I assume: offloading risk to gamepass) has stopped working. 

- When the founder of Raw Fury says that “indie publishing isnt fucked”, it’s because his buisness model (I assume: having more money in the bank than anyone else and waiting until everyone else is broke) is still working

- When Devolver is silent, then I assume it’s because they dont want to draw any attention to themselves right now

- And when I am telling you that you do not need a publisher, then it’s because I do not need a publisher right now (because Mosa Lina sold very well, a game wich I was able to self-fund thanks to the money I had left over from selling the qomp IP to Atari, which I was able to work on because of a 10.000€ loan with great conditions I got from a wealthy person who knew me because I held talks at a local convention, where I was talking about the games I’d made while living off of my parents money.)
