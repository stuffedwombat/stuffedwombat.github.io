**Do you want to present yourself for any of our readers that may not know you or your work?**

Hi, my name is Josh. I am from Austria. I’m getting really old, I’ll soon be 30 years old [laughs]. I’ve been making independent games for 10 years. They are very strange games, hard to sell but there is a small audience who likes it.

**How did you start your game dev journey?**

When I was seventeen, I was skipping school, trying to get away. And then a teacher caught me and forced me to go to his class where they were learning Scratch, which is like a game engine used to teach programming. Then I went home, bought two bottles of Pepsi and I made my first game with that. But I’ve been making board games and pen and paper games all of my life. Since I was like six years old, I’ve been telling interactive stories to my brother.

**Could you tell us a bit more about your creative process? You obviously have a lot of ideas, but how do you decide which are good?**

It’s a lot about getting interested, I get really obsessed about something. For example, I go on a lot of hiking, and then I start thinking about the difference between hiking with and without shoes. Then I figure out if you go barefoot you are constantly looking at the ground avoiding rocks, and then when you look at the sky you are like “Woah!”. But when you have shoes, you are constantly looking at the sky so you don’t notice how beautiful it is. It’s just a lot of spending time reading books, looking at trees and other stuff.

Recently, a big source of inspiration have been other games. I get really obsessed with one game and analyze the structure. Like Limbo, for example, I played it five times and wrote each puzzle in a document and put a tag on it so I can see the structure and how it works. I get really obsessed with something, and then some of it transforms into games.

**What do you do when you are mid-development and you realize it is not cool or that you lost interest?**

I just stop working on it [laughs]. It just slows down, nothing else happens. I used to just stop for a while, and then a few weeks later I start again. But now, I kind of figured it out, and for now it is working. I just make a small version of the game and then I put it away and don’t look at it. I just stop.

I only work on games as a full production if there is an external input, like someone paying me money to make a game because then I have a clear deadline. But even then, the other day for example I canceled a commission because I couldn’t focus on the game so it was not worth it.

It’s just some hippie thing. It’s so hard to stop doing something, but I didn't quit so many times already and I know it’ll hurt me. When I really force it, it never comes out as I want it to be. My future has been unclear for so long that I’m okay saying “Whatever” because, otherwise, I would be unhappy.

It often feels like you need to push through in order to sell it or finish it. And then, you focus more on having something finished instead of focusing on the work you have to do in order to finish it. It’s very compelling to think only about the future.

**From reading about you, I got the impression that you are a pretty zen guy, or hippie as you said. I find it very inspiring, because you often talk about mental health and motivation. How did you achieve that?**

Intense depression [laughs]. I was really suicidal for a large part of my life. I was really unhappy for a long time and then, making the games did something for me. When I am depressed, my memory just stops working. But then, I look back and realize I made five games. I replay one of my games and I realize how I was back then, the situation I was in, the apartment I lived in. And then I look at the present and I realize that things are different. Something has changed, I see progress in the game development and my ability to avoid depression.


But the other really important factor is just money. I know I’ll never be homeless because my parents will take me in if I run out of money. It gives so much security. I’m throwing away so much stability, but I know that I’m not in real danger. I can take huge risks and become obsessed. And then, this dream of living out of games actually pays off. I can actually do it as a full-time job and it’s very fulfilling.

**A big part of the message of Mosa Lina is that there are no perfect answers. Nowadays, I think there is a perfectionism plague in the world. Specifically, in the game dev industry, there are a lot of people that never get to make any games because of it. What are your thoughts on this?**

It’s really interesting what you said, perfectionism. That’s how I used to play Dishonored 1. It’s this emergent game where random things can happen but I wanted to play perfectly. So I want to never be seen, never do anything wrong. Every time you make a mistake, I do a quicksave. It makes it very sterile and clean.

Overtime, I realized that there is this other way of playing that is really open and free. You need to allow imperfection to surprise you. Like, for example, when you laugh at a joke it’s because you don’t expect it. If you know how it ends, it’s not funny anymore. When you hear the punchline, you get surprised and the natural response to being surprised is to laugh.

In video games, the surprise can also make you feel stupid and make you think you are bad. But it’s the safety paradox, if you want to never get hurt you have to contain yourself in a box so that nothing can get through. You are miserable, but nobody can hurt you.

**You describe Mosa Lina as an answer to immersive simulations. Was this always your objective or just something that happened along the way?**

I’m not so happy with this description now. It’s kind of academic, most people don't even know what this means. It doesn’t make much sense now. But this is where the game started. Like I said, I wanted to play Dishonored 1 perfectly, but then I realized that Dishonored 2 doesn’t care about this way of playing and it’s like a crazy sandbox. I felt betrayed, I wanted to be perfect. 

But then, I thought about what would happen if you take this to the extreme and make a sandbox that doesn’t react to you. And I came up with a videogame that doesn’t have answers to the puzzle it is presenting to you. That’s why I put it on the marketing material and Steam page, I don’t have a better way to explain it.

**I remember from your Q&A during your Mosa Lina break that you had to cut like 70% of the tools you made. Could you reveal some of them?**

I have no gifs or anything about the tool making process.  What was one… A bee! I made a bee. You shoot a little bee and when it hits the ground it grows. It follows you, and you could jump on its head and then it got confused and spun away. But it had a spike on the back, so it’s a tool that could kill you. It was useful because it always followed you, but it was dangerous.

There was another with which you could transform any tile in a zone into a traffic cone so you could move it around, and then transform it back into a tile. But with this one there were technical problems to implement. Oftentimes, the ideas are not interesting to use. I would make a prototype and, while testing it, I noticed that I never wanted to use it.

**If you had to start all over again, what would you change?**

Go outside more. I would do more sports, and talk to more people. I wish I had socialized more as a young adult. But also, not really. It’s really interesting to experience all of this for the first time as an older person.

In terms of how I’m doing my creative work and game development, I’m really happy with where I am. Because it’s a continuous exploration of stuff and I can just keep going like this. I know who I am and I know what I want. So I don’t think I would change anything.

**Do you have any tips or recommendations for someone that wants to start and get where you are right now?**

I would tell them to be really quick about it. If you have someone that you really admire, it makes sense to really push it very hard and emulate them. So you get faster to the point where you realize you are equals.

It happened to me, I really admired a couple of indie developers. And then I met them, we are peers now. And now it’s different. All of the things I thought I wanted, now I don’t really want. Getting to that moment of stopping the idealization. Then you realize that what you want and what they want is actually not the same, and that’s very powerful. Because that’s the moment where you can go and do your own stuff. It's very freeing.

Also, do stuff, and release it. Because, if you release a game, you can only understand it one year later. When you, for example, read an article you wrote one year ago, you have changed so much that you can see all the mistakes you made. But that only happens because it is finished and out of your control. If you can touch it and change it, you are screwing yourself over because you will always be changing it. But if you release it and look back you can say that it’s not perfect and the reasons behind it. It doesn’t mean the next thing will be perfect because it is an endless cycle, but it is very fun.

**Any final words? Do you want to shout out to anyone?**

Shout out to the MalagaJam team. All the volunteers who made Guadalindie possible by running around and doing extra work only because they want this really really cool event to exist.
