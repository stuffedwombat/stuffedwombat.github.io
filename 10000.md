<h1>10.000</h1>

This text has been pre-written and will go live as soon as 10.000 accounts follow me on twitter. I will examine my relationship with twitter over the last 4 years. Ever year will be summarised in ~280 characters.

<h3>2016</h3>

I joined twitter in 2016 because I wanted to be closer to my game dev heros. Seeing them arguing and talking about their work felt exciting. I learned about local meetups and conventions throught twitter, meeting many amazing people.
I tweeted about the games I was working on.


**Follower count: 151**


<h3>2017</h3>

In 2017 I held my first talks and made one game per month, gaining more followers. Newgrounds and Youtube were much more important to me than twitter. 
I met a publisher at a convention. I got a deal because I published a game on newgrounds, not because I tweeted about it.

**Follower count: 526**


<h3>2018</h3>

A gif went viral. I got hooked on likes and retweets.
Many of my heros followed me. I checked compulsively if anyone “important” started following me.
Publishing and job opportunities presented themselves, but I could not capitalise on them. I only tweeted gifs of prototypes. 

**Follower count: 3.336**


<h3>2019</h3>

Having many followers made me arrogant.
The publishing deal fell apart. 
We made Ord. 
I realised that twitter might be a big part of the game dev community, but that it is not very useful to actually sell games. 
I still compulsively made gifs until I had a mental breakdown.

**Follower count; 6.180**


<h3>2020 </h3>

When I am stressed out, I make gifs to calm down. I try to not get too invested in twitter and fail regularly.
I am struggling with handling my little amount of “fame”. I answer DMs from developers with questions. It feels nice. But I can never really explain what I went through.
