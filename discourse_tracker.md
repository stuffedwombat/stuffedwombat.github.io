[back](thinking)

*I will try to update this page whenever some "important" discourse is going on. Over time, this list should become a kind of chronic of twitter discourse.
If there is some discourse going on and I do not track it, feel free to contact me on twitter to make me aware of it!*

Tracking started in May 2021 

Last updated: May 2021

-----------

**May 2021** - People debate if you need to be really invested in a game to do good work on it.

**May 2021** - People dunk on some weirdo who complained that videogame woman are not feminine enough.

**August 2021** - I have not updated this tracker in ages. A LOT of (horrible, horrible) shit happened, but deciding *exactly* what is and what is not discourse has proven to be kind of impossible. I tried and I failed.

It was a nice idea though :)
