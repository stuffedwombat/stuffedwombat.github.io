**quick notes on knife juggling:**

for many years now i sometimes get the urge to juggle with a single knife. I want to throw the knife into the air, make it rotate X times and then catch it again, without hurting myself.

for many years I tried to get the highest possible rotation count, training myself with this system:

- throw knife and make it rotate X times
- if i catch it, X=+1 
- if i dont catch it, set X to 1 

today i just realised that while this works to get me to the highest possible X, it doesnt really cover all the areas of knife juggling, so I switched system to this:

- set a sequence of multiple throws & desired rotations (for example 1,2,1)
- attempt to succeed at this sequence
- change the sequence to be different (1,2,3 or 1,1,2 or 2,1,1 etc)

this probably builds on years of knife juggling, but it is a lot harder and a lot more satisfying to exercise not just boundary pushing (get highest X) but also control within that boundary (get complicated sequence correctly) and it led me to this conclusion:

to do something once is an achievement

to do something consistently is a skill

and i think i want to apply this principle to shipping & finishing games ðŸ™‚
(also my hand is bleeding slightly)
