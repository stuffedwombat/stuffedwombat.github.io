In this text, I will examine my relationship with game developement over the last 4 years.



##2021

qomp releases and makes back the 10k investment I got from a rich patron. Because I am living cheaply with my grandmother, I have money for a year and decide to play some of the games that I’d been neglecting to check out. I realise that Limbo & Inside have already done what I was trying to do with qomp. Disco Elysium blows my mind. I spent vast amounts of time on playing & replaying these games, analysing them and writing essays about them. I get scared about money at random intervals, but I can’t bring myself to play it safe. I decide that I need to make something radically new. Work on PRODUCER 2021, a visual novella, starts. I also spend half of the year negotiating a deal with Atari. We hand the qomp IP over to them. Now I have money for a while, allowing me to follow my interests instead of trying to catch the interest of a publisher. The low-key alcoholism and high-key tobacco abuse catch up with and I have a small stroke. PRODUCER 2021 is delayed.

2022

Lots of hiking. I spent months writing and re-writing elaborate video essays. I engage with systems. They seem like the way out of the sterility of flow and the clever-type game design I’d  been subscribing to for a long time. I loose weight, meet friends again and travel to Spain. I speedrun Dark Souls. The Atari money allows me to keep working on PRODUCER 2021. During summer, I find a deep peace in the work. It’s hard to write interactive prose, but worthwhile. I overestimated my ability to handle branching narratives and cut huge chunks out of the game. PRODUCER 2021 makes back it’s production cost, but doesn’t turn a profit.

2023

I travel a lot. Argentina, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Denmark. The world is very large and I am very privileged. I Finally overcome the fear of intimacy and rejection that had been festering inside of me for years. I try to collaborate with friends. I realise that I’m going to run out of money eventually and focus on my most commercially viable prototype. I dance in a club for the first time at Amaze. Work on Mosa Lina makes me feel that deep purpose again. I meet many cool people who know and appreciate my work. Mosa Lina’s success is unreal and hard to handle. It rejects many design principles and sells well by word of mouth. I feel vindicated and move into a shared flat with two other people, living a new and very social life. It becomes impossible to focus deeply on anything. There is a genocide and our rulers support it.

2024

I struggle with updating Mosa Lina and I hand the game over to Rollin’Barrel. The constant socialising is taking it’s toll. There’s a bad breakup. I run out of energy in a deep way but keep going out of habit. Everything looks sterile and hopeless to me. I realise that I’ve been making games for 10 years and feel like a burnt-out veteran. The genoicde keeps escalating. None of my experiments feel especially worthwhile. The well is dry, there’s no game design philosophy I want to try out. I become rude and inconsiderate to the people around me. I decide to move in a small appartement on my own. I’m reading lots of Anarchist literature and write this blogpost to gain perspective on what I’ve been doing. My money will last for one and a half years. I can do whatever I want for a while. But what do I want?


Closing statement

The last four years were built on rejection. 

I’d been making lots of action and platforming games, so I made a visual novella.
I’d been obsessed with flow and smooth difficulty curves, so I made a hostile platformer.
I’d been deeply scared of socialising and intimacy, so I gradually unbuilt that fear and returned to society.

Now, there’s nothing to reject anymore. There’s no immediate (game development) problem to overcome. I’m standing in front of a very large, very blank page.

Whatever I do next, it needs to be done out of love, not fear.

Let’s see what happens.
