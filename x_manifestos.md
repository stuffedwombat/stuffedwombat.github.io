I found a file called "X Manifestos" in my drive.<br>
It was written in 2020 and I thought it was funny.

<h1>TRUE PLAY MANIFESTO</h1>

True play happens when players can change the fundamental rules of play while playing. <br>

Playing games may contain traces of true play.<br>

Only developers experience true play.<br>

To promote true play, developers should make extremely accessible game engines & tools instead of games.<br>

Teaching others how to make game engines is more efficient than making game engines yourself.<br>

<h1>UNBROKEN PROMISE MANIFESTO</h1>

Games promise interactions.<br>

Games are systems of limited interactions.<br>

The process of finding the limits of interactions is called gameplay.<br>

Finding a limitation means that the promise has been broken.<br>

By playing a game, you are making it break it`s promise.<br>

Promises can only be broken if they have been made.<br>

Do not make games.<br>

<h1>CULT MANIFESTO</h1>

There are too many games in your life.<br>

There are not enough people who care about you in your life.<br>

We care about you.<br>

Buy our games exclusively.<br>

<h1>PERFORMANCING MANIFESTO</h1>

Creating games requires skill.<br>

A display of skill is a product in itself.<br>

Instead of selling games, monetise the display of your skill.<br>

<h1>BITTER MANIFESTO</h1>

Write manifestos that are actually subtweets <br>

Never enjoy yourself. <br>
