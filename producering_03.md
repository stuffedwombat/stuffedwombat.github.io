<h2>03 - the week of floating in modules</h2>
I am aware that the last two blog posts were messy and unreadable. I wrote them for myself, as a kind of creative diary, but this week I want to try and actually write something nice for a change :)

While I don’t want to spoil anything about Producer, revealing some basic things is unavoidable when writing a readable blogpost:

**Producer has 4 Acts.**
They flow into each other fluidly, but are distinct in how linear and/or open they are. I do a bit of work on each Act every week, to not loose sight of the bigger picture,

The first Act is basically just the Demo that has been released on Newgrounds last year. Still, I have to rewrite it and redo the art because so much in the rest of the game has changed. Keeping the great energy of the Demo throughout these changes, while also introducing all of the strange new gameplay-systems has proven to be really challenging. 


The main progress in Act 1 was the introduction of additional functions. They are not really mathematical functions, but a kind of modular text deliver system.  These semi-floating-modules tell stories that are progressing in parallel with your direct actions, but that are not directly affected by them. 

For example, I might use one of these functions to tell you that “the phone is ringing”. As long as you don’t pick up the phone, this function will get called again and again, after every single one of your normal actions. After you have picked up the phone, the function will still be called after every action, but now it returns nothing and no text is printed.
Using this kind of modular text delivery is relatively cheap and extremely effective. It weaves the world closer together and ties you to the place that your character inhabits.

This was so effective in Act 1, that I added even more of these functions to Act 2. 
The second Act is by far the biggest and most complicated. It contains as much stuff as the other three Acts combined. The new functions relate mainly to your characters changing mental state, putting them into dialogue with the narrator to negotiate their feelings. This should make the sprawling insanity of Act 2 a bit more cohesive.

Until this week, Act 3 was the most undefined. The progress here if of utmost importance. I have finally found a interesting, cheap way to break up the more adventure-y type gameplay of Act 2. I can’t really talk about this without spoiling big parts of the story.

With Act 3 clearly defined, there are now no big unknowns in the project anymore. Each Act is not just internally coherent, but also knows about and reacts to the Acts around it, not only with direct,  hardcoded reactivity, but also in terms of pacing and structure.

Since I have been trying to work from back to front as much as possible, Act 4 is mostly complete and the progress here was mainly cosmetic in nature. 
Since the sales of Producer will heavily rely on positive word of mouth, going out with a very expensive bang is imperative. The art and animations for the final Act are really shaping up and I am very proud of them.

I hope that these special moments of animation and zooms and parralax will feel really special and exciting. But even if nobody notices them, it can really not be underestimated how motivating it is to see a whole sequence wrapping up not just in terms of logic, writing, art or music, but to see it come together as a whole.

I also did a bunch of visual work on a lot of other areas. The basic take-away of this weeks visual work is that I need to stay very close to the artwork. The style of Producer relies on crunchy pixels and messy transitions. I wasted a lot of time on working on a small scale. In the end, tiny details always loose out to grand gestures. This is also true for the whole game in general. 
It are often the rough first drafts, the carelessly type together dialogues and rambles that lead to the interesting stuff. Manic polishing of a single sentence just results in overproduced, topheavy wordwork.

I realise that I completely forgot to write about my work on the games thematic conflicts, but since that will be the focus of next weeks work, I will just talk about it in next weeks blog.

Also: While writing this, I realised that the 4 Acts of Producer follow the Kishotenketsu structure of storytelling. This was not intentional, it just happened, I swear.

Cheers,
josh
