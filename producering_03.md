<h2>03 - the week of floating in modules</h2>

perceived value
monoke zoom
ending credits interactive
ending expensiveness
not too expensive, close to art and abstract
finally got a nice mall one i think

Acts & Structure
Key moment was when i put down Act 3.
It was always clear that this act would deviate heavily from the others, but now i finally found a version that works.
It's completely different from the others and should provide a nice contrast to the rest of the game before the conclusion.
I only now realise that the 4 Act structure of PRODUCER 2021 closely resembles kishotenketsu. I didn't plan that, it just happened.

Writing
work on Intro, focus on functions
semi-floating module, where text is assembled not linearly, based on immediate decisions, but more abstractedly, from systems and values and mathemetics.
This puts much needed restrictions on my writing and creates unique and fun sentence combinations.
already had something like this for 2nd act, but it was tied to a physical object.
fiction is free and i just made it into a sort of dialogue between the main charactrer and the narrator.
Many of the systems use this semi-floating module approach and now I finally wrote down all the Lore modules, which should help with writing stuff down the line.
again, the game congeals around stuff i just put down on paper.



each sequence needs a conflict, two perspectives that can fight and interact with each other.
Intro (just like in the old demo) has the conflict between your characters desolate state and the sudden responsability of a job. 
Jokes appear where those two things rub against each other.

big puzzle room first draft

fear of final writing.
just get something down. A kind of random word will spark something that can then etc etc

Cheers,
Josh
