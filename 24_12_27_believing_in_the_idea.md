After a few days away from the computer, a couple of very concrete visions have appeared.
- A text-only game about a team of archiologists.
- A new take on the bullet-trail concept
- A game design course

As hoped, all the failed attempts of the last months, finding themselves with unexpected neighbours, have merged into opportunities for new attempts.

Attempts. This is important. Right now, everything in my head is very clear.
- I have a structure that meshes really well with the themes of the text-only game. 
- I can **see** the moment-to-moment gameplay of the bullet-trail game and I have a vision of it’s larger arc. 
- I know how the design course needs to be structured and I have found a really interestening twist on the homework.

But all of this is just ideas in my head. Concrete ideas, yes, but not yet real, not yet washed up on the cold beaches of reality. It’s going to get ugly when I try to realise rough (first) version in the next weeks.

None of this has to work out. It could all fail completely and I could be left without a creative project I really believe in again. That’s okay. I don’t think it will happen. These ideas feel too concrete to go away as quickly as the articles I said I’d sketch out. Remember those? Yeah.


It’s the paradox of creative work. You need to be able to jump between different ideas quickly, but you also need to be able to pick one and stick with it for an extended period of time. Everytime I start a project, I believe in it. But that belief dissipates much, much more often than not. Most ideas remain unfinished.

So how can you make sure that an idea sticks around? how can you stop yourself from falling out of believing in it?

I’d say: Don’t worry about it too much. If an idea doesn’t stick, it shouldn’t. Forcing it to stay around will just keep you from discovering the idea that will stay on it’s own. Those are the cool ones.

There’s a lot of other stuff I could write about, but later. Not right now. It’s been a very busy time.

Merry Christmas!
